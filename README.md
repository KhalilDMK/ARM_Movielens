Association Rule Mining on movies and genres from the Movielens dataset

## Project description
E-commerce is a prevalent part of todayâ€™s commercial ecosystem. Due to its simplicity and efficiency, online shopping is in a constant unprecedented growth. This kind of commercialization went beyond usual shopping of physical products and became the standard way for certain digital material. Streaming platforms are now indeed the natural and standard way to access music, movies and series. These platforms went beyond the standard promotion of their products to offering personalized recommendations based on the likes and dislikes of the users. The Movielens dataset is a standard well known benchmark dataset in recommendation research. It includes information about a large set of movies in addition to user, movie and rating triplets.

In this notebook, we perform an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Movielens 1M dataset and further mine it using Association Rule Mining to extract common associations between genres, on the one hand, and movies, on the other hand. We generate association rules on movies and on genres that can be used for recommendation.
